                  <h2>STEP 1</h2>
                  <p>To keep your computer’s hardware in good shape, there are key tasks you should add to your list of chores — after turning off and unplugging your computer.
                  <br><br>

Wipe down your computer
Dust off the outside of your computer with a soft, dry cloth at least once a week. Remove any fingerprints on the screen. If you want to use a cleaning fluid, visit a computer store to find one that’s specifically designed for your monitor type.<br><br>

Run check disk tool
To help detect hard drive issues before they lead to other problems, Microsoft Windows provides a Check Disk tool. The tool will scan for and repair issues such as file system errors or bad sectors. If you haven’t done this scan before, run a full scan, which enables automatic repairs. The process may take a few hours.</p>                                                                     
              </div>
              
              <div class="card">
                  <h2>STEP 2</h2>
                  <p>It’s time to attend to the programs that create and store your important information. Here’s how to keep your computer’s “mind” as clean as its “body” to possibly extend its longer lifespan.<br><br>

Back up your hard drives

Backing up your data — especially important data — is a must. A laptop or tablet can be replaced, but the information inside it may be irreplaceable.<br><br>

                  <h2>STEP 3</h2>
                  <p>Several computer cleanup tools can help you on the software side of the process.<br><br>

Apple and Mac cleanup tools
Apple computers have their own unique set of computer cleanup tools. Here are three examples to consider.<br><br>

CleanMyMac X Tool
This is an all-in-one optimization tool that serves as a Mac cleaner, a performance monitor, and a malware remover.<br><br>

Disk Cleanup Pro Tool
This Mac tool can quickly remove the junk from your device without the risk of deleting the important stuff.</p>                                                                     
              </div>
              
               <a href="index.html" class="btn-2">Back</a>          
                                                                               
      </div>
       
      
      
  </body>
