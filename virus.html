                  <h2>STEP 1</h2>
                  <p>Determine what operating system you are going to attack. The most common target is Microsoft Windows, especially older versions. Many old Windows users do not update their operating system, leaving them vulnerable to security holes that may be fixed in newer versions.</p>

                  <h2>STEP 2</h2>
                  <p>Decide how you want it to spread. A virus is only a virus if it can spread to other users. You will need to figure out the delivery method before beginning, as it is one of the fundamentals of the virus's code. Common delivery mechanisms include:</p>

                  <h2>STEP 3</h2>
                  <p>Step 3 Determine the weak spot that you want to target. Successful viruses exploit weak spots in a program's or system's security to spread and carry out their actions. This requires a lot of research and know how, but there are communities out there that can help you find what you need.</p>

                  <h2>STEP 4</h2>
                  <p>Decide what you want your virus to do. Once your virus has infected a system, what do you want it to do? Effects can range from nothing, to displaying a message, to deleting files, and much worse. Be aware that creating and spreading a malicious virus is a serious crime in the most countries.</p>

                  <h2>STEP 5</h2>
                  <p>Choose a language. In order to create a virus, you will need to have at least a basic understanding of at least one computer language or scripting tool. More complex viruses often involve several languages.</p>

                  <h2>STEP 6</h2>
                  <p>Start writing your virus. This will be a long process, especially if this is your first time coding something. Experiment as much as possible, and research ways to replicate your code depending on the language you are using. There are tutorials on forums and community blogs for a variety of languages.</p>
